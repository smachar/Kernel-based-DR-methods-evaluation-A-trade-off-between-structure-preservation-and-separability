# Joint exploration of kernel functions potential for data classification and representation: A first step toward interactive interpretable dimensionality reduction

This repository contains the code used for the work "Joint exploration of kernel functions potential for data classification and representation: A first step toward interactive interpretable dimensionality reduction" by Ismail Bachchar et al supported by [SDAS Research Group](https://sdas-group.com/). The code is implemented in Matlab R2021b and uses the Live Code File Format for interactive visualization.

## Overview

The code implements an interactive framework for free parameter selection in dimensionality reduction techniques, with a focus on 
kernel-based approaches such as KPCA. The framework allows users to navigate through possible values within the interval of the free 
parameter represented in the Matlab interface. 

The resulting embedded data is visualized in real-time, allowing users to observe the 
impact of hyperparameter selection on the structure preservation and/or class separability of the data.

## Requirements

The code requires Matlab R2021b or later and the Live Code File Format extension.
